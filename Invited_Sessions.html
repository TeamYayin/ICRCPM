                  AI is seemingly inseparable today. Healthcare using AI is
                  amongst the fastest growing research area across the globe. A
                  massive amount of heterogeneous data generated in healthcare
                  sector offers enormous opportunities for data analytics using
                  AI models. Such analysis transforms data into real and
                  actionable insights to healthcare practices, thus provide new
                  understanding and ways for better and quicker treatment, and
                  improve overall individual and population health. Recent
                  advancements in AI are proving beneficial in development of
                  applications in various spheres of healthcare such as
                  microbiological analysis, discovery of drug, disease
                  diagnosis, Robot-assisted surgery, genomics and proteomics,
                  medical imaging and bioinformatics. Due to increasing
                  availability of electronic healthcare data (structured as well
                  as unstructured data) and rapid progress of data analytic
                  techniques, a lot of research is being carried out in every
                  area of healthcare including Robot-assisted surgery. Popular
                  AI techniques include machine learning/deep learning for
                  structured data and natural language processing for
                  unstructured data. Robot-assisted surgery gives doctors better
                  vision, precision, flexibility and control when they are
                  performing complex minimally invasive procedures. Robots have
                  been used in medicine for more than 35 years. They range from
                  simple laboratory robots to highly complex surgical robots.
                  Surgical robots can either aid a human surgeon or execute
                  operations by themselves. In addition to surgery, robots are
                  used in hospitals and labs for repetitive tasks, in
                  rehabilitation, for physical therapy and to support patients
                  with long-term conditions. Hence, many countries are spending
                  a lot of money today into developing these technologies. The
                  topic of this session is emerging and demanding. Discussion on
                  this topic is need of the hour. It connects four contemporary
                  areas of research: AI, Data Science, Healthcare and Robotics.
                  It will help conference to attract a significant number of
                  attendees from more than one sector such as Engineering &
                  Technology, Medical, and Industry. This session will provide
                  attendees a collective update on developments in healthcare
                  using AI & Robots, challenges, opportunities and future
                  research directions.
